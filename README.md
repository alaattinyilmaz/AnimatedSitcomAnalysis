#Description
Our main motivation in this project is to reveal the changes in popularity among a variety of animated sitcoms, such as The Simpsons and South Park, by investigating the amount of words for main characters, such as Homer, Marge, Eric Cartman and Stan Marsh, in each episode and season. We chose these series because their episodes are in an extended period of time which is useful to analyze. In order to see the changes clearly, we will compare the ratings of several animated sitcoms and see how the trends have changed in time. Moreover, we aim to examine the ratings in accordance with ‘words per character’ data to see if some characters are more favorable than others. By analyzing character features, we hope to find which specifications are found more appealing by the public. In addition to that, we believe we could reach an interesting result if we could reach to a point where we determine this ‘favorability’ relates to critical social events such as elections or how to use these results to create a role model or public opinion.
We were inspired by Todd W. Schneider who investigated The Simpsons, but we aim to extend his research to a point where we might see the concrete effects of media bias.
